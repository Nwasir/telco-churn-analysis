## AI Assistance Summary

AI was used throughout the project as a technical companion â€” guiding structure, debugging, and documentation while I remained responsible for the implementation and final verification.

### Key areas where AI contributed:

1. Project Setup:

- Helped define the folder structure (src/, data/, models/, tests/) and environment setup.

- Suggested essential dependencies for requirements.txt.

2. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering:

- Assisted in designing business-based features such as tenure_bucket, services_count, and monthly_to_total_ratio.

- Reviewed handling of missing TotalCharges values and stratified splits.

3. CLV Analysis:

- Guided creation of CLV quartiles, churn rate analysis, and visualization logic.

- Supported writing automated unit tests for validation.

4. Model Development:

Provided example configurations for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Helped implement metrics computation (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC).

5. Streamlit App Development:

- Assisted in structuring the app tabs (Predict, Model Performance, CLV Overview) and defining user interactions.

- Offered code samples for feature importance interpretability and CLV display.

6. Documentation & Testing:

- Supported the creation of README.md, testing setup with pytest, and overall project explanation.

### ðŸ’¡ Reflection

AI accelerated development by clarifying next steps, debugging efficiently, and improving presentation quality.
All final code, testing, and interpretation decisions were reviewed and validated manually before submission.
